	   TED was written by Tom Kihlken, and published in PC Magazine
	   TEDPLUS was apparently also written by Tom Kihlken
	   TED2 is basically TED with the character string search from TEDPLUS

	   TED2.COM is the executable program file.
	   TED2.ASM is the assembly language source code file.
	   TEST.BAT is used to calculate the file integrity checksum byte.

	   Even though TED2 is extensively reworked from the TED version that 
	was published in PC-Magazine, the PC-Magazine copyright is still 
	in effect (see "The Copyright Fight", PC Magazine February 24, 1987 
	pp 61,62).  I believe that this is of concern if this program were 
	to be included with or incorporated in a commercial product.  
________________________________________________________________________

Purpose:	TED, the tiny text editor, is a full-screen editor for 
		line-oriented files of up to 64K in length.  It supports 
		scrolling, cut, copy, paste, and printing operations.  
		Character string search and search again were added to 
		TEDPLUS and TED2 (TED version 2.0).  TED2 allows all 256 
		characters of the IBM-PC extended ASCII set (including 
		<Nul>, <CR>, and <LF>) to be entered.  

Format:		TED [drive:][path]filespec

Remarks:	TED will open and read a file whose name (and path, if 
		required) is initially supplied on the command line.  If 
		no filespec is provided, it will open a new file and then 
		prompt for a filename when <F2> is pressed to save and exit.  
		A legal DOS filename, and optionally a path name, must be 
		provided to close the file.  If it is desired to not close 
		the file and return to edit mode, press the <Esc> key.  
		TED2 also allows pressing any non-character (function or 
		cursor) key to return to edit mode.  The original of a 
		modified file is saved with the extension .BAK.  
		The QUIT command <Shift-F2>, when verified (with <y>, <Y>, 
		or <CR>), abandons any modifications and leaves the original 
		file intact.  If a file has been opened for editing and 
		there have been no file changes, either the <F2> or the 
		<Shift-F2> key will immediately abandon the edit copy of 
		the file, without altering the original file, and return to 
		DOS.  If the file has the Read-only attribute set, TED2 
		will open the file to allow browsing, but will not allow any 
		edit changes.  There is no "load" or "save" file function 
		from within TED.  

		TED uses certain DOS functions that require DOS version 2.0 
		or higher to run.  TED2 has incorporated a DOS version test, 
		and exits with a message if the test fails.  TED2 also 
		incorporates a one-byte check sum test of program integrity, 
		which gives a 99.7% confidence level that the program file 
		has not been accidently corrupted.

		Lines may be any length, and each must be terminated by 
		pressing <Enter> (the end-of-line marker is <CR><LF>).  
		Lines longer than the screen width display a diamond in the 
		rightmost column.  Offscreen characters (up to 248 columns) 
		may be viewed by using the Ctrl-arrow keys to move the 
		window left or right.  Lines may be broken by pressing 
		<Enter> at any point, in either Insert or Overstrike mode.  
		Lines may be joined by pressing <Del> at the line end or 
		<Backspace> at beginning.

		One end of a "block" of text is defined by toggling the MARK 
		<F4> command on, and moving the cursor with the cursor control 
		keys to the other end of the block.  The marked area is shown 
		in inverse video.  Pressing CUT <F5> removes it to a buffer 
		from which it can be pasted <Shift-F5> at any point where the 
		cursor is located.  The paste buffer remains intact until 
		another section is marked and cut.  The paste buffer has room 
		for 64K bytes.  If the MARK toggle is on, pressing PRINT <F3> 
		prints the marked text (directly from the file buffer).  
		Pressing <Shift-F3> will output a Form-feed character to 
		position the printer to the top of the next page.

		Pressing DEL_L <F9> or <Shift-F8> deletes the entire line 
		and closes the gap.  Pressing DEL_EOL <F8> or <Alt-D> 
		deletes from the cursor position to the end of the present 
		line.  Pressing UDEL_L <F10> restores the most recent line 
		deletion.  The line delete buffer remains intact until 
		another line is deleted.  The line delete buffer has room 
		for 255 characters.

		The UNDO <F7> command restores up to 255 characters deleted 
		by the <Del> key or over written while in the Overstrike mode.  
		The UNDO buffer is cleared when the cursor is moved.  It 
		will only restore the last key deleted with the <Backspace> 
		key (the <Backspace> key is implemented as <Left-arrow><Del>). 

		TEDPLUS added a string SEARCH and SEARCH AGAIN function.  
		In TED2, <F6> or <Alt-S> is SEARCH, and <Shift-F6> or 
		<Alt-A> is SEARCH AGAIN.  When the <F6> is pressed, the 
		prompt "SEARCH> " appears on the bottom line.  Enter the 
		desired text string and press the <ENTER> key.  If the 
		string is found, it appears in inverse video on the screen.  
		To search for the next occurance of the string, press 
		<Shift-F6>.  The inverse video is extinguished when any 
		key is pressed.  
		NOTE: TEDPLUS and TED2 use a DOS function to enter the search 
		string.  As a result, TED2 can enter characters that cannot 
		be searched for.  These are <Nul>, <LF>, <CR>, and <Esc>.

		Text is entered in insert mode by default.  Pressing the 
		<Ins> key toggles between Insert and Overstrike mode.  The 
		Insert/Overstrike state is displayed by an 'I' or 'O' in 
		the lower right corner of the screen.  If the file has the 
		Read-only attribute set, an 'R' is displayed in the lower 
		right corner of the screen and no edit changes may be made 
		to the file.

		The ASCII Backspace (BS) code can 
		be entered as <Ctrl-H>, the Cariage return (CR) code, as 
		<Ctrl-M>, and the Line feed (LF) code, as <Ctrl-J>.  The 
		<Enter> key enters a new-line (CR)(LF) marker, and the 
		<Backspace> key deletes the character to the left of the 
		cursor.  Any of the characters in the IBM extended ASCII 
		set (except <Nul>, 00H) can be entered by pressing the Alt 
		key, typing its ASCII decimal value on the numeric keypad, 
		then releasing the Alt key.  TED2 allows entering the <Nul> 
		code with <Shift-F1>.

		TED2 does not use the CPM style End-of-file marker, <Ctrl-Z>, 
		to indicate the last character in a text file.  If a Ctrl-Z 
		character appears in the file, it is ignored.

		TED configures itself to the display in use, and supports 
		EGA and VGA text modes other than the standard 80 columns 
		by 25 rows (eg. EGA 43 lines).  It does not alter screen 
		attributes or colors.  Inverse video is used to indicate 
		a MARKed block.  TED2 uses blinking inverse video to indicate 
		that the search string has been found.  PgUp and PgDn scroll 
		the file by the number of rows displayed, minus five.  It 
		automatically handles "de-snow" on a CGA display.  Because 
		TED makes BIOS calls and writes directly to the screen buffer, 
		it could have problems with MS-DOS computers that are not 
		sufficiently IBM-PC compatible.  

		TED was written by Tom Kihlken and was published in PC 
		Magazine in November 1988.  TEDPLUS appears to have also been 
		written by Tom Kihlken in November 1988.  It was obtained 
		from a Bulletin board service in June of 1989.  I entered 
		TED from the magazine article listing when it was published.  
		I found and fixed some minor bugs and added some enhancements.  
		When I obtained TEDPLUS, I incorporated SEARCH and several 
		other functions into my version of TED.  I also added a HELP 
		screen.  TEDPLUS attempted to allow entering any key code 
		into a file.  The ASCII <CR> and <LF> codes can now be 
		directly entered as <Ctrl-M> and <Ctrl-J>.  If they are 
		entered together, or ever become ajacent, they become an 
		end-of-line marker.  The end-of-line marker may not ever be 
		separated into <CR><LF> characters to keep TED2 from losing 
		track of the cursor location.  The <Shft-F1> key is now used 
		to enter the <Nul> character, making it possible to enter 
		all of the 256 IBM extended ASCII set.  The screen update 
		has been changed to look for any keys-waiting at the end of 
		each line to improve the keyboard responsiveness.  This is 
		especially noticable when scrolling the file up or down.  
		To protect against a possible corrupted program file, there 
		is a one-byte program check sum test which is run when the 
		program is started.  The inverse of the check sum value is 
		returned as a DOS ERRORLEVEL code (the reason it is limited 
		to one byte).  If the check sum value is not zero, the 
		program terminates with the message "TED altered".  
		On top of everything else, TED2.COM is still a tiny program.  
		It fits in 4096 bytes, four clusters on a 360K floppy disk.
